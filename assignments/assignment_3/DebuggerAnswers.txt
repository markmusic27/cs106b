Q1:
The parent function that calls drawFlagOfRecursia() is doTheThing()
and is defined in the file FlagGUI.cpp under the Demos folder.



Q2:

The drawFlagOfRecursia() function drew 6765 triangles.


Q3:

Each recursive function call of drawAccuteTriangles results in the addition of two triangles
seen in line 45 by the addition of triangles drawn. Hence, knowing that when order=0 (end of recursive stack),
the triangles drawn is zero. The number of triangles drawn would be 2^6=64.
