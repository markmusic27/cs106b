## What are graphs?

Graphs are not math graphs. Instead, they are abstractions of things that happen on the real world. Like a social network.

**Definition:**
A graph is a mathematical structure for representing relationships.

They consist of a set of **nodes (or vertices)** and are connected by **edges (or arcs).**

### Are graphs trees?

Trees have some hierarchy, graphs do not.

### Examples

- US Freeway System
- Chemical Bonds
- Flow Chart

### Directed Graphs

Edges have arrowheads so the edges are not bilateral links, they have some diction to them. So say you can represent tournaments by having nodes be competitors and edges that point to who lost each match between two nodes. Hence, the node with the most amount of edges directed towards it is the loser.

### Undirected Graph

Edges are just links between nodes. Hence, you can either have two nodes that are connected or are not connected.

## Representing Graph

You can do it with pointers.

```cpp
struct Node {
	string value;
	Vector<Node*> edges;
}
```

But you donâ€™t need to do this with dynamic memory allocation necessarily!

### Adjacency List

You can make a table representing each node and have a column that represents the connections to that node.

![CleanShot 2025-03-16 at 16.36.28@2x.png](Graphs%201b8b37deb65d8020b1d7d7823f7895f7/CleanShot_2025-03-16_at_16.36.282x.png)

```cpp
Map<Node, Vector<Node>> graph = {...}
```

This is called an **adjacency list**.

### Adjacency Matrix

You can have an Adjacency Matrix where the nodes are the columns and rows of the matrix and there is a $0$ if there is no connection and a $1$ if there is a connection.

This is just a square matrix that you can square or cube. $A^2$ gives you the *two-step* paths between node $i$ and node $j$. More generally, $A^k$ gives you the *k-step* paths between node $i$ and node $j$.

### Other Representations

Most backtracking problems just go through and find the best way to traverse a graph.

![CleanShot 2025-03-16 at 16.47.24@2x.png](Graphs%201b8b37deb65d8020b1d7d7823f7895f7/CleanShot_2025-03-16_at_16.47.242x.png)

For instance, the `shrinkableWord()` method that used recursive backtracking is just finding if it can traverse a certain amount of edges to shrink a word if the other word is valid.

Here, each stop where you explore a new decision becomes a split in the graph.

## Traversing Graphs

You can traverse a graph in several ways.

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)

One of the things that you could do is find all of the nodes that are connected to a node given some distance from the node. This distance is a connection distance.

- If $\text{distance}=1$, then return all of the nodes that are directly connected to that node
- If $\text{distance}=2$, then return all of the nodes that are connected

You can implement this in code by creating a queue where you add all of the newly discovered nodes. These nodes are the nodes that are *n-steps* away from the starting point.

```bash
In pseudocode:

bfsFrom(node v) {
	make a queue of nodes, initialy with v
	
	while the queue isn't empty:
		dequeue a node curr
		process the node curr
		
		for each node adjacent to curr:
			if that node has never been enqueued:
				enqueue that node
}
```

In this way, you kind of keep on going through the layers (increasing the connection degree) until you find something.

**Dijkstra's algorithm** is an example of BFS where each edge has some weight and you want to find the shortest path by minimizing weight.

### Depth-First Search (DFS)

**Rule:** keep trying new experiences! Always go somewhere new if you can, and only go back up if thereâ€™s nothing new to see.

### How can you implement this?

You prioritize whatâ€™s farthest away and hasnâ€™t been seen over what has been seen. So instead of a queue you use a stack where first in is first out.

```bash
In pseudocode:

dfsFrom(node v) {
	make a stack of nodes, initialy with v
	
	while the stack isn't empty:
		pop a node curr
		process the node curr
		
		for each node adjacent to curr:
			if that node has never been pushed:
				push that node
}
```

Anytime that something is implemented with stacks, think recursion because its literally the same thing!!!

```bash
Recursively:

dfsFrom(node v) {
	if this is first time we've called dfsFrom(v):
		process node v:
		for each node adjacent to v:
			call dfsFrom on that node
}
```
